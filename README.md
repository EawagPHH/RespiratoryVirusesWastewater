- wwtp: Wastewater Treatment Plant
- sample_date: date of collection of the influent wastewater sample, DD/MM/YYYY
- Target: virus RNA quantified.  IAV refers to Influenza A Virus; IBV refers to Influenza B Virus; RSV refers to Respiratory Syncytial Virus; N1 refers to SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene target; N2 refers to SARS-CoV-2 N2 gene target
- Protein: target region of the digital PCR assay
- Load: total number of genome copies measured for the sample date, calculated by multiplying the concentration of RNA in the wastewater by the total flow rate of wastewater on the sample collection date.
